Burger Sequelize App

This app is powered by express, node, mySQL, sequelize, javascript, handlebars, and HTML
This app is the sequel to the first burger app and is comnepletely refactored using sequelize's orm models 
When the app is loaded the user is presented with a few burgers that exist in the database. 
The user can "eat" the burgers by clicking the devour button.
This changes their data and places them into the devoured column.
After being devoured, these burgers can be removed by clicking the all done button.
This deletes the burger from the database and upon page refresh from the page.
Users can also add their own burgers to the database by using the input bar and clicking the submit button.
